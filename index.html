      <h1>James 3</h1>
      <p class="about">
        6 The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the
        body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on
        fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. <br />7 All kinds of animals,
        birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been
        tamed by man, <br />8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless
        evil, full of deadly poison. <br />9 With the tongue we praise our Lord
        and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's
        likeness. <br />10 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My
        brothers, this should not be. <br />11 Can both fresh water and salt [1]
        water flow from the same spring? <br />12 My brothers, can a fig tree
        bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce
        fresh water. <br />13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him
        show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from
        wisdom. <br />14 But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in
        your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. <br />15 Such
        "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of
        the devil. <br />16 For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there
        you find disorder and every evil practice. <br />17 But the wisdom that
        comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate,
        submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
        <br />18 Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.
